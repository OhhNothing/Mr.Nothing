    <h1>Hallo & welkom to my BLOG</h1>    
    <h2>Basic info (about me)</h2>    
    <p>I am 10 & I already know coding. Don't be sarcastic by saying wow, just tell me if you like it or not. And I'm cool if you just exit, hate my page, & clear this from your browsing history. And I know, this looks like an old website, but it's just because I learned HTML websites from Khan Academy. Please don't hate me Khan Academy but your lessons need new updates. (PS. they are not that bad) </p>    
    <h2>A little more to know about me</h2>    
    <p>I play lots of games, and when I say lots I mean LOTS. <br>
 I also have a merch store, wait wait wait, I shouldn't be telling you this.<br>
 No no no no no no no no no!<br>
 Okay, if I learn how to make a part where I can put a comment section, I will make it on my page so you can tell me about it & why it is so bad.</p>
<h3>Wierd Talk</h3>
<h4> I know this page is allready a bit weird, but I'm going to add a section to why it's weird.</h4>
<p> What sould I add on this part of the page? What did you say, A WEIRD PARRAGRAPH, well that's a great idea. Yep I know, I made this alot weirder. Also if you want to check out my merch store, look all the way at the bottom of the page. My so called "Name" is Ohh_Nothing or Mr.Nothing</p>
<h1>B Y E</h1>
<h3> Wait, YOU CAN GO NOW!</h3>
<p> Don't ever try coming back again!</p> 
<p> Wait don't go. I have a image for you.</p>
<p> Nevermind </p>
<p> YOU CAN GO NOW </p>
<p> No wait, I just learned how to put links in to my webpage! Be right back with the links</p>
<h4>okay, Links!</h4>
